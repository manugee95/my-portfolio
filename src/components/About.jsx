            I began my career as an instructor, teaching full-stack development
            to aspiring developers. I specialized in both frontend and backend
            technologies, including Python (Django), JavaScript (React,
            Express.js), PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB. Transitioning into a
            full-time software engineer, I have since built and contributed to
            several impactful products, including a tracking and auditing
            software, an e-commerce platform, an audience measurement system and
            so on. My expertise lies in designing and developing scalable,
            high-performance applications that solve real-world problems. I am
            open to contract jobs, freelance roles, and collaboration
            opportunities where I can leverage my skills to create innovative
            and efficient digital solutions. Letâ€™s build something great
            together!
